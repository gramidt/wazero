# wasm_exec reference

This package contains imports and state needed by wasm go compiles when
`GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`.

## Introduction

When `GOOS=js` and `GOARCH=wasm`, Go's compiler targets WebAssembly 1.0 Binary
format (%.wasm).

Ex.
```bash
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o my.wasm .
```

The operating system is "js", but more specifically it is [wasm_exec.js][1].
This package runs the `%.wasm` just like `wasm_exec.js` would.

## Identifying wasm compiled by Go

If you have a `%.wasm` file compiled by Go (via [asm.go][2]), it has a custom
section named "go.buildid".

You can verify this with wasm-objdump, a part of [wabt][3]:
```
$ wasm-objdump --section=go.buildid -x my.wasm

example3.wasm:  file format wasm 0x1

Section Details:

Custom:
- name: "go.buildid"
```

## Module Exports

Until [wasmexport][4] is implemented, the [compiled][2] WebAssembly exports are
always the same:

* "mem" - (memory 265) 265 = data section plus 16MB
* "run" - (func (param $argc i32) (param $argv i32)) the entrypoint
* "resume" - (func) continues work after a timer delay
* "getsp" - (func (result i32)) returns the stack pointer

## Module Imports

Go's [compiles][3] all WebAssembly imports in the module "go", and only
functions are imported.

Except for the "debug" function, all function names are prefixed by their go
package. Here are the defaults:

* "debug" - is always function index zero, but it has unknown use.
* "runtime.*" - supports system-call like functionality `GOARCH=wasm`
* "syscall/js.*" - supports the JavaScript model `GOOS=js`

## System Calls

"syscall/js.*" are host functions for managing the JavaScript object graph,
including functions to make and finalize objects, arrays and numbers
(`js.Value`).

Each `js.Value` has a `js.ref`, which is either a numeric literal or an object
reference depending on its 64-bit bit pattern. When an object, the first 31
bits are its identifier.

There are several pre-defined values with constant `js.ref` patterns. These are
either constants, globals or otherwise needed in initializers.

For example, the "global" value includes properties like "fs" and "process"
which implement [system calls][7] needed for functions like `os.Getuid`.

Notably, not all system calls are implemented as some are stubbed by the
compiler to return zero values or `syscall.ENOSYS`. This means not all Go code
compiled to wasm will operate. For example, you cannot launch processes.

Details beyond this are best looking at the source code of [js.go][5], or its
unit tests.

## PC_B calling conventions

The assembly `CallImport` instruction doesn't compile signatures to WebAssembly
function types, invoked by the `call` instruction.

Instead, the compiler generates the same signature for all functions: a single
parameter of the stack pointer, and invokes them via `call.indirect`.

Specifically, any function compiled with `CallImport` has the same function
type: `(func (param $sp i32))`. `$sp` is the base memory offset to read and
write parameters to the stack (at 8 byte strides even if the value is 32-bit).

So, implementors need to read the actual parameters from memory. Similarly, if
there are results, the implementation must write those to memory.

For example, `func walltime() (sec int64, nsec int32)` writes its results to
memory at offsets `sp+8` and `sp+16` respectively.

## Go-defined exported functions

[Several functions][6] differ in calling convention by using WebAssembly type
signatures instead of the single SP parameter summarized above. Functions used
by the host have a "wasm_export_" prefix, which is stripped. For example,
"wasm_export_run" is exported as "run", defined in [rt0_js_wasm.s][7]

Here is an overview of the Go-defined exported functions:
 * "run" - Accepts "argc" and "argv" i32 params and begins the "wasm_pc_f_loop"
 * "resume" - Nullary function that resumes execution until it needs an event.
 * "getsp" - Returns the i32 stack pointer (SP)

## User-defined Host Functions

Users can define their own "go" module function imports by defining a func
without a body in their source and a `%_wasm.s` or `%_js.s` file that uses the
`CallImport` instruction.

For example, given `func logString(msg string)` and the below assembly:
```assembly
#include "textflag.h"

TEXT ·logString(SB), NOSPLIT, $0
CallImport
RET
```

If the package was `main`, the WebAssembly function name would be
"main.logString". If it was `util` and your `go.mod` module was
"github.com/user/me", the WebAssembly function name would be
"github.com/user/me/util.logString".

Regardless of whether the function import was built-in to Go, or defined by an
end user, all imports use `CallImport` conventions. Since these compile to a
signature unrelated to the source, more care is needed implementing the host
side, to ensure the proper count of parameters are read and results written to
the Go stack.

### (Lack of) Concurrency

Go generated Wasm is not goroutine safe, so runtimes do not need to implement
concurrency apart from trying to prevent it in API and/or documentation.

This may seem strange because Go's [function wrapper][9] used for `GOOS=js` is
implemented using locks. For example, seeing this, you may feel the host side
of this code (`_makeFuncWrapper`) should lock its ID namespace as well.

What makes this difficult to see is that the locks used by `GOOS=js` are
implemented with [atomics][10] defined by `GOARCH=wasm`.

This codebase is waiting for the "Threads" proposal to finish and be
implemented in Go. However, as of mid-2022, the ["Threads" proposal][11] is
still not finished. Even if it did, it would be at least another release of Go
before it could be usable.

In summary, runtimes should not allow concurrent use of Wasm generated by
`GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js`.

## Memory Layout

Memory layout begins with the "zero page" of size `runtime.minLegalPointer`
(4KB) which matches the `ssa.minZeroPage` in the compiler. It is then followed
by 8KB reserved for args and environment variables. This means the data section
begins at [ld.wasmMinDataAddr][12], offset 12288.
